# PRVD Charter
-------------

## 1. Project Name
	
### 1.1 Full Name

PRVD OASIS Open Project 

### 1.2 Short Name

prvd-oasis

## 2. Abstract

PRVD advances a leading production-grade reference implementation of the [Baseline Protocol](http://baseline-protocol.org), an open standard that helps synchronize multiparty workflows across a variety of sectors and permeate decentralized finance throughout global commerce.

## 3. Statement of Purpose

PRVD, an OASIS Open Project, promotes the development and adoption of the application programming interfaces (APIs), data models and binary runtimes for the Baseline Protocol, based on the Provide Stack components being contributed to the project. Various components of the Provide Stack are referenced in the published draft standard specifications of the Baseline Protocol.

Permissionless validators running the PRVD Stack achieve network consensus on cryptographic proofs which have been generated and deposited by one organization and propagated to interested counterparties. When recursive zero-knowledge proofs are deposited by organizations using the stack, validators assert and attest to various states and propose blocks containing zk-rollup proofs for deposit on EMV-compliant networks.

As more and more organizations depend on the Provide Stack in their everyday production environments, it's clear that the work should not be controlled by one company. That's why its creator, Provide Technologies Inc., is contributing the stack to the PRVD project, where it can be governed and maintained by the open community for the public good.

Like the Baseline Protocol itself, the PRVD project operates under the OASIS Open process, which ensures the transparency and operational integrity necessary for fostering adoption and a thriving community of innovators.

PRVD embodies the ethos of public blockchain and decentralized business networks manifest in global commerce for the benefit of humanity.

## 4. Business Benefits 

The PRVD project brings together an ecosystem of stakeholders including vendors, service providers, end users and thought-leaders, who use or have interest in contributing to the PRVD Stack.

Senior technical leaders and digital transformation professionals from Global 2000 companies and organizations within large, segmented value chain networks should consider being represented in PRVD. Any business that would gain from more insight into costly exceptions in their supply chain should be involved in PRVD.

Given the current direction of distributed architectures and anticipated demand for web3, organizations (vendors, end users and service providers) will seek to contribute and participate by joining the PRVD PGB (Project Governing Board). The architecture is enabled at its core by cloud-native infrastructure and the introduction of advanced cryptography to synchronize streaming data across otherwise disparate systems. The lack of synchronization between these systems has remained an unsolved problem at global scale; PRVD is the solution.

Given that the Baseline Protocol requires finality by way of a CCSM (consensus controlled state machine), organizations can adopt this technology stack without requiring internal blockchain expertise and immediately deliver significant business value to itself and the PRVD community. In addition to contributing to the public good, organizations contributing to PRVD will gain exposure and recognition as thought leaders in a new paradigm of private enterprise data sharing and decentralized finance.

Organizations can benefit in the following ways by joining the PRVD community:

1. Introduce members to a leading web3 enterprise ecosystem
2. Establish new web3 business models and participate in the DeFi ecosystem
3. Expand commercial relationships and value to existing customers
4. Showcase and contribute expertise to the open-source community
5. Unlock strategic partnership opportunities within the ecosystem
6. Participate as a thought leader in the development of open-source DAO constructs for the enterprise
7. Earn equitable governance representation
8. Contribute to public goods for enterprise

## 5. Normative Scope

Focused on ensuring production deployment and productive commercial use, PRVD operates under the same governance and process rules as EEA Community Projects and Baseline.

PRVD scope includes the following functions:

1. Maintaining the Baseline, Ident, NChain, Vault and Privacy microservices, which comprise the “core” architecture
2. Maintaining pgrok, an SSH client/server for developing multiparty messaging applications
3. Maintaining destiny, the first provide.network consensus client
4. Maintaining 12 libraries and SDKs for building client-side applications
5. Advancing the architecture and relevant standards beyond the initial contributions made by Provide

## 6. Relationship to Other Projects

- EEA Community Projects (including but not limited to the following)
  - Baseline Protocol; PRVD is a leading production reference implementation
  - JSON-RPC: PRVD utilizes this standard heavily
  - L2: Provide is actively contributing to this initiative

- MQTT: PRVD anticipates utilization of the MQTT OASIS standard by users; NATS natively supports MQTT

- NATS: PRVD utilizes NATS heavily for internal and point-to-point messaging

- ODATA: PRVD anticipates utilization of the ODATA OASIS standard by users; the Technical Steering Committee will be responsible for scoping and prioritizing work related to this project

- PostgreSQL: PRVD utilizes PostgreSQL heavily for internal persistence

- Redis: PRVD utilizes Redis for internal caching
