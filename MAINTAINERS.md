# PRVD Maintainers

Maintainers are individuals who take an active role in the operations of one or more PRVD project repositories to advance the overall technical roadmap on behalf of the community from architecture, source code, testing and quality assurance perspectives. Maintainers, in partnership with the [TSC](https://github.com/prvd-oasis/oasis-open-project/blob/main/TECHNICAL-STEERING-COMMITTEE.md), are collectively responsible for the following across all PRVD project repositories:

- Contributing to the technical design and architecture of the PRVD stack
- Contributing source code by opening pull requests to fulfill functional and nonfunctional roadmap requirements
- Reviewing and providing feedback on open pull requests to ensure sufficient code quality, performance and scalability standards for use in commercial production environments
- Maintaining compliance with and proposing further contributions to the [Baseline Protocol standard](https://github.com/eea-oasis/baseline-standard)

# Becoming a PRVD Maintainer

There are two ways to become a maintainer:

- A simple majority of existing maintainers appoint you and you accept such appointment
- You open a pull request to one of the existing PRVD project repositories and it is merged by the maintainers

In either of these scenarios, you become a "provisional maintainer." As such, you will need to demonstrate consistent technical contributions to the project. These contributions should of course be technical in nature, such as in the form of opening new pull requests, providing meaningful feedback on pull requests opened by other contributors, participating in architecture review sessions or writing documentation for the project.

All provisional maintainers must meet with the existing maintainers and demonstrate they are capable of the following:

- Running the PRVD stack locally
- Running the various PRVD stack test suites
- Explaining the Ident, Vault, NChain, Privacy and BPI microservice components of the PRVD stack architecture
- Explaining the steps required to create a new Baseline workgroup, invite a counterparty organization and create a simple workflow

Once a provisional maintainer demonstrates an understanding of the above capabilities and concepts, a simple majority of existing maintainers may vote to welcome the prospective maintainer to the maintainer team, at which time the new maintainer will be added to one or more projects as an authorized `CODEOWNER` at the discretion of the maintainers and TSC. Maintainers listed as `CODEOWNERS` of a PRVD project repository are authorized to merge pull requests based on the requirements established for that project. The TSC will assist the maintainers team with governance and step in should a dispute arise among the maintainers.

# What is expected of maintainers?

In general, a maintainer needs to:

- have a high degree of understanding of the project architecture
- be an expert in one or more fields related to the project
- attend weekly maintainer meetings 
- reliably complete work to which they have accepted responsibility
- show commitment over time with multiple PRs merged (or otherwise demonstrate equivalent, consistent contributions to the project as described herein)
- demonstrate competency in software engineering and test-driven development
- follow the project style and testing guidelines
- follow branch, PR, and code style conventions
- contribute in ways that substantially improve the quality of the project and the experience of organizations using it as well as other developers
- be welcoming and kind to others in the community who are using the project

# PRVD Maintainer Resources

## Slack

Maintainers meet and discuss issues virtually via the private #maintainers slack channel in the [PRVD slack](https://prvd-oasis.slack.com).

## Meetings

The maintainers will work as a team and organize meetings as needed to discuss the roadmap and issues related to the various PRVD projects, including release planning and other related topics. These meetings may or may not be public, at the discretion of the maintainers hosting the meeting.

A regular cadence of meetings will be agreed upon and this document will be updated accordingly in the coming weeks.

# Resigning PRVD Maintainership

As a maintainer, you may resign (or be asked to resign) your maintainership by doing any of the following:

- You ghost the project
- You are disrespectful toward other community members
- You are disruptive to the general process of maintaining the project
- You violate the [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- You notify the TSC and the other maintainers that you are electing to relinquish your maintainer status

A supermajority vote among all maintainers is required to remove a maintainer. The TSC, at the request of the maintainer who is subject to removal in this manner, will arbitrate any such dispute. The TSC is responsible for overseeing general governance matters related to the maintainers and technical operations of the various projects, repositories and the PRVD Open Project as a whole.
